# SharePointDSCSimpleFarm
These files will build out a SharePoint farm and DSC Push server using minimal interaction from you.  

These are the configuration I have tested (I will update this as I perform more testing):
1.	DSC Service on Windows 2016 with WMF 5.1, Windows 2012 R2 with WMF 5.0 and WMF 5.1
2.	SharePoint 2016 on Windows 2012 R2 with WMF 5.0 and WMF 5.1
3.	Multiple SharePoint Server Farm

Uses several DSC modules like SharePointDSC (Go check out that project)

This script is currrently being expanded, please let me know what you would like to see added to it. via Issues list.
