These files will build out a SharePoint farm using minimum interaction from you.  For more information asnd a how to see this blog https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/christwe/2017/11/16/how-to-build-a-sharepoint-farm-using-dsc-my-first-github-project/

These are the configuration I have tested (I will update this as I perform more testing):
1.	DSC Service on Windows 2016 with WMF 5.1, Windows 2012 R2 with WMF 5.0 and WMF 5.1
2.	SharePoint 2016 on Windows 2012 R2 with WMF 5.0 and WMF 5.1
3.	Multiple SharePoint Server Farm
4.	Single Server SharePoint Farm
NOTE: I plan to expand to SharePoint 2013 and SQL Always-on sometime in the future.
